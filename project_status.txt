Project Status: CoffeeTrack

Completed:
- Basic project structure setup
- Theme system implementation (colors, typography, light/dark mode)
- Provider state management setup
- Main screens structure (Auth, Home, Profile)

Technology Decisions:
- Using Firebase for backend (after evaluating Azure)
  - Better real-time capabilities
  - Simpler setup and maintenance
  - More cost-effective for initial deployment
- Keeping Google Maps integration
  - Best accuracy for business locations
  - Comprehensive Places API
  - Familiar user experience
  - Reasonable free tier limits

In Progress:
- Firebase integration
  - Authentication setup
  - Firestore database configuration
  - Storage setup for images
- Maps and location services implementation

Next Steps:
1. Core Features Implementation
   - Firebase Authentication integration
   - Firestore data structure setup
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Local data caching with SQLite
   - Image upload and storage system

2. UI/UX Implementation
   - Coffee shop details screen
   - Review creation/editing functionality
   - Search and filtering options
   - User profile editing
   - Favorites system
   - Maps integration with custom markers and info windows

3. Advanced Features
   - Geofencing for nearby shop notifications
   - Social features (following, sharing)
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Offline support with sync

Required Setup:
1. Firebase Configuration
   - Project setup
   - Authentication methods
   - Firestore rules
   - Storage rules
2. Google Maps API setup
   - API key configuration
   - Places API activation
   - Maps SDK setup for iOS/Android
3. Environment variables
4. Platform-specific configurations

Known Issues:
- None at the moment (initial implementation)

Architecture Notes:
- Using Provider for state management
- Implementing clean architecture principles
- Local caching with SQLite for offline support
- Custom theme system for consistent UI
- Firebase for backend services
- Google Maps for location services

Performance Considerations:
- Implement lazy loading for map markers
- Cache map tiles for offline use
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Use Firebase indexing for faster queries
- Implement pagination for lists and reviews
